Hi,

This is Pratap.

I am learning Devops. I practice this on daily basis.

I need to get a job on Devops with good package.

I am going to complete GIT practice by this week end.

I am going to practice 2 classes of Linux and Tomcat parallerly everyday to achecive my goal at any cost.

I'm not going to loose my confidence.

I should prove myself. Its time to prove with a good job and good package.
